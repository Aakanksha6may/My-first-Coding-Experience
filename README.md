# My-first-Coding-Experience
👋 Starting my C programming with our precious - Hello World.

But before that I had no idea about IDE, where I can code, where I can run my program. I'm sure many of you would have faced the confusion before the coding game starts.
So, I downloaded GCC compiler. But, Alas! 😏 it didn't worked on my system, always showing error or popping a dialouge box 🗃️ written worng file, etc. This happend many times. I tried to install thic compiler and tried to run it on my system. But it didn't.


Then I started with Dev C++, this works good for me.


My first programming code is -


#include<stdio.h>

void main()

{

printf("Hello World");

}


👀 I know just by watching these random text, you must be confused like me. So, don't worry. I'll try to explain. Include stdio is a standard input output header file in c. It is a library due to which we can input or display our output. Next is the main() function as we aren't providing any value to main() function that is main() function is null function so we wrote void before main() funtion that is void main(). And then the content we need to display will be inside function so after main function we insert two culy braces{} and in this curly braces we have to code for the output. So we want to print hello world. So, inside {}, we will write printf and then after printf we use parenthesis and under double quote" inside parenthesis() we write what we want as ouput and at the end use semi colon ; which is very important.
That is  printf("Hello World");

📝And here you're done with your code for your first programming- Hello World.

📌 Save this file on the notepad where you're typing the code with .c extension. For example I saved my file on the desktop with 1.c , After  this click on the saved file on the desktop as I'm using DevC++, it opened in it and then for run+compile , I clicked F11 as there was no error, so the output occured on the screen Hello World.

😌 In this way, I did my first programming, full of curiousities, confusions but at the end I was happy as if I have achieved something big.💞
